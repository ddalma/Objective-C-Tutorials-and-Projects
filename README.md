# Objective-C-Tutorials-and-Projects




Inspired by my mobile application class this Spring 2015, I have decided to dive right into mobile application programming, most specifically in IOS. I'm learning not only the history of how iPhone apps are made, but I will be implementing them as well. Although I am learning alot from my class, I am a firm believer that to learn how to program a specific language well, one must create a project with it. I challenge myself to create at least one iPhone app per week, because by doing this, not only strengthens the lessons I learn in my mobile application class, but overall I get one step closer to being a competent mobile app developer.Armed with books, tutorial guides, and the internet, I have inifinte resources to make this journey not only interesting but full of learning oppurtunities!
